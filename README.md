# Tonalflex Example UI

This repo is meant to easily show how to utilize the micro-frontends exported by each Tonalflex plugin to `npm`, and how do dynamically load them into a larger UI project.

The example also shows in `src/main.ts` how the MockBackend that ships with each micro-frontend can be utilized to quickly visualize a plugin UI in a larger setting, without having to implement the full `IAudioBackend` interface.
